Subject: CPUC Audit Report on Edison 
 
The following are the highlights from the Executive Summary of the KPMG audit  
report on Southern California Edison: 
 
I. Cash Needs 
Highlights: 
SCE ,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a complete  
cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a  
program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligations  
and other measures.  
Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE ,s  
available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51.8  
million to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash  
conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date. 
II. Credit Relationships 
Highlights: 
SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to  
extend or renew credit as it has become due. 
At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE. 
SCE ,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to default.  
Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due and  
payable. 
SCE ,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond  
indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more  
indebtedness if it were feasible to do so. 
Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE ,s credit ratings on most of its  
rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade  
issues within the last three weeks. 
III. Energy Cost Scenarios 
Highlights 
This report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess  
various price scenarios upon SCE ,s projected cash depletion dates. Under such  
scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001. 
IV. Cost Containment Initiatives 
Highlights 
SCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001. 
The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital  
improvement component as follows (in millions): 
Operating and maintenance costs $ 77 
Capital Improvement Costs 383 
Total $ 460 
The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to  
be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming from  
contract employees. 
Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the  
most part being deferred to a future date. 
SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and  
executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost  
savings of approximately $92 million. 
V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA  
Activity) 
Highlights: 
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the  
Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This  
includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500  
million and accelerated revenues of $175 million. 
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE ,s  
Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion. 
Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at the  
end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit  
balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to  
D.01-01-018. 
Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from  
generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are  
tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as  
expressed in the TRA, are overstated. 
TURN Proposal 
As part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TURN  
to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition assets.  
Our comments are summarized as follows: 
The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that it  
would not directly generate nor use cash. 
The Proposal ,s impact on SCE ,s balance sheet would initially be to shift  
costs between two regulatory assets. 
TURN ,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and the  
revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection in  
the TRA is overstated. 
VI. Flow of Funds Analysis 
Highlights: 
In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a  
positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion. 
During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to  
its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion. 
Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its  
shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding common  
stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrative  
and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes. 
[there is no Section VII] 
 
VIII. Earnings of California Affiliates 
SCE ,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500  
million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.  
In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.  
This increase correlates to the increase in market prices 
for natural gas for the same period.
